## How to Use

### Editing Locally

To edit this resume locally, make sure you have LaTeX installed on your machine. You can download the LaTeX distribution for your operating system from [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) for Linux, [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) for macOS, or [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/) for Windows.

Once LaTeX is installed, you can use any LaTeX editor like TeXShop (macOS), TeXworks (cross-platform), or any IDE with LaTeX support like Visual Studio Code to edit the `.tex` file.

Compile the `.tex` file to produce a PDF.

### Editing on Overleaf

If you prefer using Overleaf, the online LaTeX editor, follow these steps to import the project:

1. **Download the Repository**: Click on the `Code` button on the GitHub repository page, and then click `Download ZIP`. Unzip the downloaded file to get access to the `.tex` resume template.
2. **Go to Overleaf**: Visit [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) and sign in or create a new account.
3. **Create a New Project**: Click on `New Project` and select `Upload Project`. Upload the ZIP file that you downloaded from GitHub.
4. **Compile and Edit**: Once the project is uploaded, Overleaf will automatically compile the resume for you. You can then start editing the `.tex` file. To see the changes, simply save the file and Overleaf will automatically recompile the PDF.

## Customizing the Resume

Feel free to customize the `.tex` file to fit your needs. The document is well-commented to help you understand which parts to edit.
